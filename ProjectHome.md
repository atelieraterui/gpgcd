GPGCD is an algorithm for calculating approximate GCD of univariate polynomials. We provide an implementation of the method for computer algebra system Maple.
# Try the GPGCD library #
  1. Download and unzip the archive file.
  1. Open Maple worksheet.
  1. Follow the contents in the worksheet for demo calculation.
  1. You can take a look for some more comments in the code (.mpl files).
  1. If you have further questions, please contact to developer (see developer's homepage).
